# Carbon Ledger ‚Äî Local Demo

Minimal instructions to run the demo locally and the required `.env` variables.

## Minimal `.env` example
Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following (replace the placeholder values):

```env
# Hedera account used as operator / treasury (example format: 0.0.12345)
MY_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID

# Private key for the above account. Provide either DER or HEX representation.
# Use `MY_PRIVATE_KEY_DER` for DER, or `MY_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX` / `MY_PRIVATE_KEY` for hex/raw.
MY_PRIVATE_KEY_DER=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

# Hedera network to target: testnet | mainnet | previewnet
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet

# Optional: port for the API server
PORT=3000

# Optional: portal token for external services (if used)
HEDERA_PORTAL_TOKEN=
```

Notes:
- Keep your `.env` out of version control. `.gitignore` should already ignore `.env`.
- The server will validate presence of `MY_ACCOUNT_ID` and one of the private key vars at startup and exit if missing.

## Quick run (PowerShell)
Start the API server (runs server.js):

```powershell
npm run api
```

Serve the frontend (in a separate terminal):

```powershell
npx http-server public -p 8080
```

Open the UI at http://localhost:8080 and use the Quick Sell modal to test HTS transfers (requires a funded testnet account and the appropriate token). The API server will handle Hedera calls and stream logs to the UI.

---
If you want a more secure production setup, consider using a secrets manager instead of `.env`.

## About

üåç **Carbon Ledger on Hedera**

Carbon Ledger on Hedera is a transparent registry for verified carbon emission certificates and offset tokens. It enables organizations and individuals to issue, track, and trade carbon offset tokens (vCO‚ÇÇ) on the Hedera Testnet, ensuring accountability and trust through distributed ledger technology.

The system connects two main registries ‚Äî
- an emission certificate ledger, recording verified carbon emissions, and
- an offset certificate ledger, representing verified carbon compensation efforts.

When an organization generates more offset credits than emissions, the surplus can be tokenized and traded, creating a sustainable carbon economy.

Built with Hedera Hashgraph, this project demonstrates how transparent, efficient, and eco-friendly digital infrastructure can accelerate climate action. üåø
