# 🌍 Carbon Ledger — Hedera Hackathon Project
A transparent carbon accounting and offset platform powered by **Hedera Hashgraph (HCS + HTS)**. Track emissions, tokenize carbon offsets, and trade them securely on-chain.

## 🧠 Project Overview
Carbon Ledger enables transparent and auditable carbon tracking using Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and Hedera Token Service (HTS).  
It allows organizations to:  
- Record verified carbon emission reports on HCS  
- Mint and manage carbon offset tokens via HTS  
- Sell offsets directly through an integrated API  
- Visualize the process in real time through a live dashboard  
This project was built as part of the **Hedera Global Hackathon 2025**, focusing on sustainability, traceability, and blockchain-driven environmental accountability.

## 🧩 Architecture
**Backend:** Node.js and Express – REST API interacting with Hedera HCS and HTS  
**Frontend:** Static web dashboard (from `/public`) for data visualization  
**Ledger:** Hedera Hashgraph for distributed, tamper-proof recording  
**Integration:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time logs and updates

- 🔗 Tokenize carbon offsets using Hedera Token Service  
- 💰 Trade offsets securely between participants  
- 📊 Visualize live transactions on a dashboard  
- ♻️ Promote sustainable, auditable climate action

🌱 Why Carbon Ledger? 

Traditional carbon markets are often opaque and fragmented.
Carbon Ledger introduces transparency and automation by recording all actions on Hedera Hashgraph — making carbon offsets auditable, traceable, and trustworthy.
Our mission is to enable organizations to verify and offset their emissions efficiently, supporting a greener planet through open and reliable t
